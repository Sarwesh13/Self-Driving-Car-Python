# Self-Driving-Car-Python

This code was inspired by Radu Mariescu-Istodor's JavaScript tutorial.

This code is divided into independent modules and chapters. 
Module 2 is a simple car game with keyboard inputs, whereas from Module 3, we connect a neural network to control the movements of the car
We train the neural network in Module 4, and have a self-driving car which avoids the traffics and road borders perfectly by the end.

I used python's pygame module for writing this code.
